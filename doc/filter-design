Title: How to write a filter for mappage
License: GNU GPL

1. Introduction
---------------

A mappage filter is a Python script (of course it hasn't be) which
decides if box (line of text, image, noise) should be marked as line
in result document.

As first parameter it gets file name, it's both input and output file,
input is destroyed then.

It might get additional parameter in order to tune filter work (it's
implemented in mappage but not used at the moment).

Line order in input is order given by OCRopus.
Line order in output is not important at all.


2. Input
--------

Filter input is text file with lines describing each box.
Line consists of coordinates of found box separated by one space.
Line format is:

<left> <bottom> <width> <height>

Point (0, 0) is in the lower left corner, just as in DjVu.


3. Output
---------

Filter should decide which boxes is line in fact and give them numbers.
Output is very similar to input. The only difference is line number
(found or guessed by filter, not line number in output file).
Line format is:

<line-number> <left> <bottom> <width> <height>
